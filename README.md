# 🎮 Retro RPG-Themed Portfolio Website

Welcome! This repository contains the source code for my personal **retro/pixel-art/video game–inspired portfolio website**.  
The site is both a professional portfolio and a creative coding project — designed to feel like you’re playing through a classic RPG, while still presenting my skills and experience in a recruiter-friendly way.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
This project was built with a modern frontend stack while keeping the retro feel:

- **React (Vite)** → component-based structure, fast dev environment.  
- **Tailwind CSS v4** → utility-first styling, with custom theme tokens for fonts and brand colors.  
- **Framer Motion** → smooth transitions, CRT flicker, hover animations.  
- **Custom Fonts** → [Pixel Game](https://www.1001fonts.com/pixel-game-font.html) for titles and branding, paired with a body font for readability.  
- **React Bits** → curated set of reusable React components (to be used in later iterations for form handling, layout helpers, etc.).  
- **Canvas API** → used for the Pong mini-game.

## 🎨 Design Choices
- **Pixel aesthetic**: heavy use of retro fonts, icons, and pixel art.  
- **Green brand color (#1A786D)**: consistent across resume button, badges, and accents.  
- **Accessibility**: text is always contrasted, and all sections work in both dark and light modes.  
- **Professional + Playful**: While whimsical in theme, the structure follows recruiter expectations (About → Skills → Experience → Projects → Resume → Contact).

---

## 🔮 Future Plans
- Add more **React Bits** components to streamline forms and layouts.  
- Expand the **Projects Shelf** with more cartridges and interactive hover states.   
- Deploy via **GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify** for easy recruiter access.
